<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The purpose of this seminar is to provide an overview of advanced spatial statistics.
The overview has two dimensions. In the first, we will explore the literature from a select number
of areas within the broader field of spatial statistics. The second dimension focuses on the computational aspects
of spatial statistics. Together these dimensions provide participants with both a theoretical grounding as well
as first-hand experience in implementation and application of spatial statistics.</p>
<h2>Student Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>Students will demonstrate their mastery of the subject by: (a) presenting an overview of
a particular area of spatial statistics and lead discussions on the current related literature; 
(b) implementing spatial statisitical techniques on empirical datasets; (c) documentation of the implementation
in an open source spatial analysis package; (d) giving a short presentation that outlines their implementation, the case
study application, and summarizes the results of their project.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>All participants are expected to have working knowledge of spatial
analysis concepts and to be familiar with multivariate statistics. No
extensive GIS background beyond ArcGIS/QGIS basics is needed. Basic programming at the level of
writing scrips will prove helpful.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grading will be assigned on the following scale: A: 90-100, B: 80-89,
C:70-79, D: 60-69, E below 60. There will be no curves. I will
assign +/- on an individual basis. Points are assigned as follows:</p>

<h3>Attendance/participation</h3>
<p>As the seminar meets once per week, attendance is vital. Students are expected
to be actively engaged with the discussions of the reading materials as well as
in collaboration in the implementation and application of the techniques in
open source software. Each week will will first adopt a traditional seminar
format where one student will present an overview of one area of spatial
statistics. The student will also lead the discussion of the assigned articles.
All students are expected to participate in these discussions.</p>
<p>Following a short break, we will then shift to the hands-on component of the
course. Students will learn basic computational skills associated with the
application, development, and implementation of spatial statistical software.</p>
<h3>Discussion lead</h3>
<p>Each student will select from an approved area of spatial statistics and is
responsible for presenting an overview of that topic.  In addition to the lead
article assigned by the instructor, each student is required to identify and
synthesize two additional readings.</p>
<h3>Project implementation</h3>
<p>All students will carry out a small spatial statistics software research project
that applies a selection of the methods covered in the readings.
The hands-on component of the course will rely on the Python Spatial
Analysis Library: <a href="http://pysal.org/">PySAL</a>. Each student project will
focus on one aspect of this open source library. This offers the
students opportunities to collaborate on refining an existing component
of the library or to work towards the implementation of new
functionality.</p>
<p>As PySAL is based on the language Python, it runs on all major platforms
(Windows, Mac OS X and Linux).  <strong>We will cover
<a href="{filename}tools.md">installation</a> of these packages early in the
semester and you are strongly encouraged to bring your own laptop to
class so that you may work with these packages outside of the classroom
availability.</strong></p>
<p>All projects must be approved by the instructor.  Details on the
projects will be given out early in the semester.</p>
<h2>Classroom etiquette</h2>
<p>To ensure a productive learning environment, all participants are
expected to abide by the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because we are meeting in a computer laboratory food is strictly
    forbidden in the class meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of the classroom computers should only be in support of the
    course. Extracurricular use (i.e., browsing non-course materials,
    using social networks, checking email, chat sessions, etc.) during
    class meetings is disruptive for your colleagues and disrespectful.
    Individuals violating this rule will be asked to leave for that
    course session.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Readings</h2>
<p>Assigned readings are listed in the <a href="http://sjsrey.github.io/gph596s16/pages/schedule.html">Schedule</a> and
are be done prior to class meeting.</p>
<p>Additional readings will be assigned by topic.</p>
<h2>Academic integrity</h2>
<p>The ASU student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into five broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating on an academic evaluation or assignment,
plagiarizing, academic deceit, such as fabricating data or information,
aiding academic integrity policy violations and inappropriately
collaborating, or falsifying academic records. For more information
about the ASU student academic integrity policy, please use the
following web link <a href="http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity">http://provost.asu.edu/academicintegrity</a></p>
<h2>Disability accommodations</h2>
<p>Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the semester either during office hours or by
appointment. Note: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the Disability Resource Center (DRC) is
required. Disability information is confidential.</p>
